          During my Innovapost work term, it was decided from the 
          first goal planning meeting that I would be showcasing the 
          research and knowledge gained during the first month of 
          work by creating a small program. Calculating the estimated 
          time for an epic was a useful endeavour that tied all the 
          topics and that no one had yet created anything for, so the 
          task was assigned to me.
        </p>

        <p>
          Working independently as a DevOps engineer co-op student, 
          I created an application that could be run from command 
          line using Groovy and the Jira REST API. Using the “GET” 
          request method from the URLConnection class, I requested 
          JSON content to parse using JsonSlurper into a map. The map 
          was then iterated through, and the estimated times for each 
          story within the epic were added together and sent back to 
          update the proper field in the parent epic using the “PUT” 
          method. The final application was presented to the team 
          during one of the daily stand-up meetings, and no flaws 
          were picked out.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through the process of creating the Estimated Time 
          application, I learned about REST APIs, how to connect to 
          URLs with an application, the Groovy language and how it 
          ties to Java. Groovy and Jira Cloud REST API 
          documentation, sample code in GitHub repositories and 
          confused forum posters were all helpful in my journey to 
          complete the estimated time application. I believe if I had 
          the chance to recreate the artifact, I might remove some 
          redundant code and clean up the formatting, but overall, it 
          would not change all that much.

          <h2>Jira KPI Report</h2>
          <span class="subtitle">
            This KPI report detailing the team’s Jira activities 
            was generated for the month of January on February 2, 
            2022.
          </span>
        </p>

        <p>
          Before starting my work as a DevOps engineer, my 
          understanding of agile approaches to software 
          development was fairly shallow. At most, I could list 
          the points on couple slides from my Software Design course 
          and speak of the one time I implemented Scrum in a group 
          project. At Innovapost, one of my early goals was to 
          integrate myself into the agile process that the DevOps 
          teams had already put into effect and re-introduce myself 
          to the Scrum framework.
        </p>

        <p>
          The agile workflow of the team I was allocated to 
          relied heavily on Jira Software and the Kanban or Scrum 
          features that could be applied to each project. Taking 
          part and facilitating the daily stand-up meetings was 
          part of the process, but the stories and Kanban board 
          on the Jira interface gave me a concrete visual display 
          of my progress in learning agile methodology. The Jira KPI 
          report was a step beyond that, where a snapshot of the 
          team’s advancement was caught and preserved.
        </p>

        <p>
          The report itself was created as a page in the team 
          Confluence space, using JQL search filters and 
          Confluence macros such as pie charts and graphs. The 
          format followed all the KPI reports prior to January, 
          so there was little challenge or trouble there. Each 
          section listed a different statistic to note and review 
          at the end of the month, and outliers were taken into 
          consideration to be adjusted the next month.
        </p>

        <p>
          By constructing the Jira KPI report, I was able to 
          familiarize myself with Jira advanced search and Confluence 
          macros, as well as understand the data useful to the team 
          for planning and review purposes.

          <h2>PULSE KPI Report</h2>
          <span class="subtitle">
            This KPI report detailing the team’s PULSE activities 
            was generated for the month of January on February 18, 
            2022.
          </span>
        </p>

        <img src="img/KPI_Pulse.png" alt="PULSE KPI Report" />

        <p>
          The greatest portion of my tasks during my time as a DevOps 
          engineer consisted of Jira and Confluence administration 
          and support due to the nature of my team. Employees working 
          at Innovapost, Purolator and other Canada Post companies 
          sent service requests through the PULSE ticketing system, 
          and the requests were then assigned to teams within the 
          organization and allotted to a specific member. Service 
          requests assigned to the Productivity Tools team usually 
          consisted of tasks like adding custom fields to issues, 
          creating Jira projects or checking employee departures. 
          Similar to the monthly Jira KPI report, the PULSE KPI report 
          was a way of showcasing each member’s ticket completion at 
          the end of the month.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first half of creating the January PULSE KPI report 
          went without mistakes. The instructions for adding a new 
          column profile and generating an event search for the KPI 
          in PULSE were clear and straightforward, and I completed 
          the tasks in less than an hour. It was only when it came 
          to exporting the information and inputting it into the Excel 
          spreadsheet that errors started occurring.
        </p>

        <p>
          For a reason not yet known then, the Excel VBA code could 
          not work on my machine. At first, I assumed it was an issue 
          with the Excel application itself and upgraded it to 
          Microsoft 360. When it continued to fail, a Teams meeting 
          was scheduled and the team member who created the code used 
          the remote control feature to debug it. By then, the KPI 
          report had already been pushed to mid-February, but the 
          problem was finally solved and the task could be concluded.
        </p>

        <p>
          While producing the PULSE KPI report might have consisted 
          mainly of confusion over the Excel script, the activity did 
          allow me a glimpse into how VBA code in Excel functioned and 
          the specifics of creating a PULSE event search.

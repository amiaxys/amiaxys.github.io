        <h2>Estimated Time Application</h2>
        This program was created as a stand-alone application 
        to calculate estimated time for epics in Jira Software 
        projects and was presented on February 17, 2022.
      </p>

      <p>
        During my Innovapost work term, it was decided from the 
        first goal planning meeting that I would be showcasing the 
        research and knowledge gained during the first month of 
        work by creating a small program. Calculating the estimated 
        time for an epic was a useful endeavour that tied all the 
        topics and that no one had yet created anything for, so the 
        task was assigned to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Working independently as a DevOps Engineer co-op student, 
        I created an application that could be run from command 
        line using Groovy and the Jira REST API. Using the “GET” 
        request method from the URLConnection class, I requested JSON 
        content to parse using JsonSlurper into a map. The map was 
        then iterated through, and the estimated times for each story 
        within the epic were added together and sent back to update 
        the proper field in the parent epic using the “PUT” method. 
        The final application was presented to the team during one of 
        the daily stand-up meetings, and no flaws were picked out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through the process of creating the Estimated Time application, 
        I learned about REST APIs, how to connect to URLs with an 
        application, the Groovy language and how it ties to Java. 
        Groovy and Jira Cloud REST API documentation, sample code in 
        GitHub repositories and confused forum posters were all 
        helpful in my journey to complete the estimated time 
        application. I believe if I had the chance to recreate the 
        artifact, I might remove some redundant code and clean up the 
        formatting, but overall, I don’t think I would change all that 
        much.

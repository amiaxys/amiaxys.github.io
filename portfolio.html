        <h2>Audio Visualizers</h2>
        <p>
          I created a
          <a href="/audio-visualizer">simple audio visualizer</a> created to
          test Web Audio API functionality with multiple choices of 2D graphics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the experience I gained from the first audio visualizer, I
          developed an
          <a href="audiovisualizer.live">augmented reality audio visualizer</a> with more
          detailed options to configure a specific 3D visualization, user login
          and more.

          <h2>Now Mobile Application</h2>
          <span class="subtitle">
            This app was developed as a mobile version of MyMarketPlace, a
            platform mainly for submitting requests, and was presented to RBC
            executives on December 13, 2022.
          </span>
        </div>

        <img
          src="img/Now_Mobile_Slide_Screenshot.png"
          alt="Now Mobile Title Slide"
        />

        <p>
          During my RBC work term, it was decided from the beginning of the term
          that I would be working on a project with a team of co-op students,
          two developers and two business systems analysts. The goal was to
          develop an app called Now Mobile, and the app was to be a mobile
          version of an already existing platform within the ServiceNow product
          suite. It resolved a business need for work during travel, since
          opening up an app during commute or a business trip was more efficient
          than booting up a laptop.
        </p>

        <p>
          Working together with the Now Mobile team as a developer co-op
          student, we designed a mobile application that would allow internal
          RBC employees to request items, read knowledge articles, approve
          requests and delegate tasks to other employees when they are away.
          Using the app builder available within the ServiceNow platform and
          JavaScript syntax, we created new components, debugged existing ones
          and rearranged the UI so that it would match RBC branding. The final
          application was presented to executives after it entered the final
          stages of testing, and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through the process of creating the Now Mobile application, I learned
          about the ServiceNow platform, how to work with another developer in a
          team, and all the formal stages of software development. App builder
          documentation, free ServiceNow courses, and fellow employees who took
          time out of their day to help me when I had trouble were all helpful
          in my journey to develop the mobile application. I believe if I had
          the chance to recreate the artifact, I might remove some redundant
          changes and speed up the solving of early technical issues, but
          overall, it would not change all that much.

          During my Innovapost work term, it was decided from the first goal
          planning meeting that I would be showcasing the research and knowledge
          gained during the first month of work by creating a small program.
          Calculating the estimated time for an epic was a useful endeavour that
          tied all the topics and that no one had yet created anything for, so
          the task was assigned to me.
        </p>

        <p>
          Working independently as a DevOps engineer co-op student, I created an
          application that could be run from command line using Groovy and the
          Jira REST API. Using the “GET” request method from the URLConnection
          class, I requested JSON content to parse using JsonSlurper into a map.
          The map was then iterated through, and the estimated times for each
          story within the epic were added together and sent back to update the
          proper field in the parent epic using the “PUT” method. The final
          application was presented to the team during one of the daily stand-up
          meetings, and no flaws were picked out.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through the process of creating the Estimated Time application, I
          learned about REST APIs, how to connect to URLs with an application,
          the Groovy language and how it ties to Java. Groovy and Jira Cloud
          REST API documentation, sample code in GitHub repositories and
          confused forum posters were all helpful in my journey to complete the
          estimated time application. I believe if I had the chance to recreate
          the artifact, I might remove some redundant code and clean up the
          formatting, but overall, it would not change all that much.

          <h2>Jira KPI Report</h2>
          <span class="subtitle">
            This KPI report detailing the team’s Jira activities was generated
            for the month of January on February 2, 2022.
          </span>
        </div>

        <img src="img/KPI_Jira.png" alt="Jira KPI Report" />

        <p>
          Before starting my work as a DevOps engineer, my understanding of
          agile approaches to software development was fairly shallow. At most,
          I could list the points on couple slides from my Software Design
          course and speak of the one time I implemented Scrum in a group
          project. At Innovapost, one of my early goals was to integrate myself
          into the agile process that the DevOps teams had already put into
          effect and re-introduce myself to the Scrum framework.
        </p>

        <p>
          The agile workflow of the team I was allocated to relied heavily on
          Jira Software and the Kanban or Scrum features that could be applied
          to each project. Taking part and facilitating the daily stand-up
          meetings was part of the process, but the stories and Kanban board on
          the Jira interface gave me a concrete visual display of my progress in
          learning agile methodology. The Jira KPI report was a step beyond
          that, where a snapshot of the team’s advancement was caught and
          preserved.
        </p>

        <p>
          The report itself was created as a page in the team Confluence space,
          using JQL search filters and Confluence macros such as pie charts and
          graphs. The format followed all the KPI reports prior to January, so
          there was little challenge or trouble there. Each section listed a
          different statistic to note and review at the end of the month, and
          outliers were taken into consideration to be adjusted the next month.
        </p>

        <p>
          By constructing the Jira KPI report, I was able to familiarize myself
          with Jira advanced search and Confluence macros, as well as understand
          the data useful to the team for planning and review purposes.
